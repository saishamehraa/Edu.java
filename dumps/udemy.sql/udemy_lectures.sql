This proactive approach helps organizations strengthen their security defenses by fixing these weaknesses before they can be exploited. Ethical hackers, also known as white hat hackers, use similar techniques and tools as their malicious counterparts, but their purpose is to enhance security rather than compromise it. This course will cover the principles of ethical hacking, techniques for penetration testing, and how to secure systems effectively.','https://youtu.be/2VSNn7UIXn8?si=Q1LJg9QhDYUuf3PW','https://youtu.be/cKEf8H9cQGM?si=dkQiZrqTPgqRb-Zi','Cyber Security','Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing');
